# Motion Triggered CCTV Recognition System

This is a real-time motion detection and recording system built using Flask, OpenCV, and HTML5 video streaming. The app captures live video from your system's webcam, detects human motion using face and full-body classifiers, and automatically records short clips when movement is detected.

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/motion-triggered-cctv.git
cd motion-triggered-cctv
```

Or manually download and extract the ZIP.

---

### 2. Make Sure `utils.py` Contains:

```python
import os

def ensure_folder_exists(folder_path):
    if not os.path.exists(folder_path):

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python CCTV.py
```

### 4. Use the Program

* A window titled **"Camera"** will open showing your webcam feed.
* The script detects **faces** and **full bodies**.
* When motion is detected:

  * A video starts recording.
  * It saves in the `recorded_videos/` folder with a timestamped filename.
* If there's no motion for 5 seconds, recording stops.
* Press `q` to quit the application.
